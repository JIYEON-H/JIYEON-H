# Hi, I’m Jiyeon 👋

**Developer & Systems Analyst** focused on building reliable, data-driven operational platforms.

I work at the intersection of software development and system analysis — designing structured workflows, building RESTful services, and supporting enterprise-style systems where data integrity and long-term maintainability matter.
